# linx_challenge

my_script.py contains all the python code I used in the challenge.

In order to run it, you will need to install the following packages:

ndjson (0.1.0)
numpy (1.15.0)
pandas (0.23.4)

if there is any problem, these are the packages I have installed:

ndjson (0.1.0)
numpy (1.15.0)
pandas (0.23.4)
pip (9.0.1)
pkg-resources (0.0.0)
python-dateutil (2.7.3)
pytz (2018.5)
setuptools (39.0.1)
six (1.11.0)

And lastly, the question_3_list.zip file needs to be unzipped before you can use it on the code
